# UI

 [] make the target area for the menu button larger (see shoptiques.com)
 [] add oauth service icons to the login menu
 [] close the menu when you scroll
 [] allow click and drag to access menu items
 [] small dialogs that overflow cause the title bar to scroll
 [] add "or" text to the HR in the invite dialog
 [] add a graphic showing merge of services see img/2014-02-27-01.JPG
 [] the spocdoc logo shouldn't be a link when you're on the landing page
 [] reorder the sidebar so that the content shows up at the top first
 [] esc key should dismiss the dialog (but keyboard focus should remain unchanged)
 [] when the "log in" text in the menu isn't visible (instead showing just an arrow), the header should be present without back button

# implementation

 [] dialog has a "small" outlet. this was to make the width of the centering div smaller
